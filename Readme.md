				Shopine - Online Shopping Search</h1>
			<p>
				<a name="user-content-summary" /> Shopine leverages Shopine REST Service API to enable one stop search of products from some of the most popular on-line retailers, such as Amazon and ebay. One single search action from user will trigger the service to spin off multiple searches across the retailers. The searches across multiple retailers happen con-currently. No long wait. The service aggregates returns from all retailers in a single return in a unified format to client.</p>
				<br/>
			We've built a few clients:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Desktop app
			   </li>
				<li>
					Web app
			   </li>
				<li>
					Mobile app (available at Google App Store and Apple App Store)
			   </li>
			</ul>
			<p>The desktop app and mobile app are built in same Python Kivy code. Source ccde is pushed here.</p>
